## Notes

Used https://github.com/shamofu/electron-react-parcel-boilerplate to generate template. Look there if ever writing tests

#### BUGS:

- fix drag while changing tabs
- no selection on buttons
- moving tab to button doesn't work

#### TODO:

- introduce concept of boards
- default tab
- how do I make this secure?
- how do I organize buttons, executions?
- should it be the responsibility of electron to re-toggle the previous window?
- use https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-better-ipc instead?

use https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html#ad-output to format code into a string

use https://github.com/satya164/react-simple-code-editor for a react code editor
